## Installation
1. Clone my repo
2. Open your terminal and  run `npm install` to download the necessary node modules

## Usage
1. Once everything is downloaded, in the terminal run `npm run lupe`
2. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:9000` you should now be able to see and use my application! :)


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, EJS
Under the Hood: This is a simple application with the concept of CRUD in mind. Using node, express modules, MongoDB and the server localhost 3000 I was able to connect the front and back ends. Initially while running command line all updates were made with node server.js, this was tedious and I eventually installed nodemon to take advatange of its ability to auto update the server. An html.ejs file was used as a template to reduce the amount of code needed to get this app running. This method allows me to define something once and reuse it throughout my application. A back up index.html page was added for trouble shooting. The JavaScript handles event listeners, any get, post, put or delete requests. You will notice this when adding to the messages input and clicking on the thumb or trash icons.

## Optimizations
With more time I would have liked to add music and a option for users to submit there own images of encounters with Lupe Fiasco. I would also add login for user verification.
